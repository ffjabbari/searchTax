# searchTax
how to create this project:
1.  git clone git@github.com:ffjabbari/searchTax.git
2.  npm install
3.  npm start
4.  Go to Chrome and do this command:  http://localhost:3000
5.  in the search bar type house
6. You have the pagination button PREV an NEXT which can use to paginage the results of your your search.
This REACT APP uses the following public API to view the SHOWS by entering a search argument like "house".

The public API which you can use in postman is: 
https://movie-task.vercel.app/api/popular?page=1

The operation is GET.

Please accept this as the starting point to do my assignment, and once I can get the API working ( as it did not work for me as documented in my email), then I use the TAX data to display instead off the SHOWS as it is today...
However, you can do search and pagination in this release and then I change the shows to TAX once I get your API working.
The API based on the instruction was to get OAUTH2.0 TOKEN and put it in the HTTP HEADER AS "Authorization": "ey.....token.....", which I did but I kept on getting 401 RC from POSTMAN... 
So I decided gto start with this REPO and once I get your API working I will reneder the TAX API data instead.
I have a day job so I can not spend too much of my time on this roject...  Which is not fair to my current Client...
However this example works fine for SHOWS, if you just follow my instruction on this README FILE....
Thanks...

P.S. you can also put breakpoint in Chrome for this APP and debug it by going to DEV TOOLS, and finding the source and putting breakpoint on it...

Thanks
